									<h2>About Me!</h2>
									<p>Hello! My name is James Condos, I have just graduated from my BSc in Mathematical Physics and my Diploma
										in Computer Science in 2022, and am beginning a MSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Melbourne in 2023.<br><br>

										My passion in STEM comes from my interests in Machine Learning, AI, and Physics specifically. These fundemental ideas are pushing the envelope of human nature, and
										what is inherently contributing to a better tomorrow.
										My experience and project work has been spread out across mutliple disciplines, and am actively trying to get more involved
										in interesting engineering and research projects, whilst also gaining more 
										experience in industry. 
										<br><br>In this way, I wish to push humanities understanding of the universe and ourselves, through advancing AI, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Physics.

									<h2>Melbourne Space Program ACRUX-2 Co-Lead</h2>
									<p style = "color: white; display: inline;">Jan 2022 - Current</p>
									<p>I am currently the Co-Lead of my team ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Systems) 
										for the launch of our 3U cube satellite of dimensions 30 <span>&#215;</span> 10 <span>&#215;</span> 10 cm.
										<br><br> My job is leading my team in task allocation and work, while having a heavy focus on technical work also. 
										This includes working with microcontrollers for sensors such as magnetorquers, accelerometers, sun sensors, 
										and hardware such as reaction wheels utilising PID control to orient the satellite in space. I also work with 
										algorithms utilising machine learning for image recognition and stabilisation such as the B-Dot Algorithm and Triad Algorithm.

									<h2>Mathematics Teaching Assistant</h2>
									<p style = "color: white; display: inline;">Feb 2023 - Current (Part-Time)</p>
									<p>

										I am currently a Mathematics Teaching Assistant at Caulfield Grammar School, where I am mainly helping and teaching students 
										in the areas of their maths that they would like to excel at and improve in. 
										<br><br>
										This comes from myself organising lessons
										for students, asssting teachers in lesson plans, working in teaching teams and attempting to give students 
										in years 7 - 10 the motivation they need.
